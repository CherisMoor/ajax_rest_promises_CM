-Response: is text, usually nowadays in JSON
	-JSON: JavaScript Object Notation
- Native API, but libraries like jQuery wrap that API to make it easier to use


API: Application Programming Interface
- It defines how applications talk to one another (how they request resources and send resources)

HTTP Verbs
1. GET - requests data, parameters in querystring
2. POST - submits data to be processed, parameters in body
3. PUT - Adds or replaces item at a specific location
4. DELETE - Deletes an item at a specific location

REST(REST API Principles)
REST is a pattern for organizing APIs with a few simple rules:
1. Use HTTP request types as VERBS
2. Use URLs to represent unique resources (NOUNS)

***Examples:***
RESTful
- GET '/items'
- POST'/items/3

NOT RESTful
- POST 'items/new'
- GET '/items/add'
- DELETE 'items/removeitem/1'

CORS: Cross Origin Resource Sharing
- by default, AJAX requests are only allowed within the same domain that the browser is on
- A server has to enable CORS to allow browsers from other domains to make a successful request

Callback Function
- a function (named or anonymous) that is given as the parameter of another function
- they aren't executed when they appear in a file, rather they are "called back" upon via another function getting executed

Promises
- A promise is an object that represents an eventual value
- Promises allow asynchronous (happening at different times) code to behave sychronously (happening once)
- built into the latest version of JavaScript (ES6)
- Parallel execution: perform a bunch of operations and then do something when they've all been completed

Why use Promises over a Callback Function?
- Promises can be chained together to perform multiple dependent asynchronous (happening at diff times) operations
- Error handling can be done in order
